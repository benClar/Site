###Core Gameplay
Users will be ranked based on their gold/ Assets.  Users can select others from this ranking to attack, to steal gold and damage other player's assets.

###Clans
Users can create and join clans for attack/ defensive benefits.  Clan leaders can purchase clan items and manage clan financaes to improve benefits for members.

###Community
The game and forum should be closely tied: in game benefits for posting, forum features that support clans.
